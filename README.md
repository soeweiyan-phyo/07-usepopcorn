# usePopcorn üçø

## Overview

`usePopcorn` is a React-based movie search application that allows users to search for movies, view details, and manage a list of watched movies. The application leverages the OMDB API to fetch movie data based on user queries.

## Features

1. **Search Movies**: Users can search for movies using the search bar. The search results are displayed in a list format with movie posters, titles, and release years.

2. **Movie Details**: Clicking on a movie from the search results displays detailed information about the movie, including its poster, title, release date, runtime, genre, IMDB rating, plot, actors, and director.

3. **Watched Movies List**: Users can add movies to their "watched" list. The watched list provides a summary of the movies, including the average IMDB rating, average user rating, and average runtime.

4. **User Rating**: Users have the ability to rate movies they've watched. The application provides a star rating component for this purpose.
